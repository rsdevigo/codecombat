# This script is for pushing changes in /dev to the gh-pages branch.
# Probably actually shouldn't use it. If there's anything uncommitted
# or unpushed at all, things may not work, and a commit could be pushed
# to the repository.

# Perhaps better to just copy and paste these into the command line
# until someone with better bash-fu and git-fu than me makes this thing.

git pull
git push
git checkout gh-pages
git checkout master dev

rm -rf dev
git add -A
git commit -m "Updated from master."
